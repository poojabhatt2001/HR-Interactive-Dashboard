# HR-Interactive-Dashboard
 I developed a comprehensive project in Excel using multiple dashboard and table to analyze the data. This process involves several stages  data processing , data manipulation, data visualization.

## Project Objective
The overall objective of this project is to create a comprehensive, interactive monitoring and analysis tool for Human Resources performance and planning.The main goal is to shift HR analysis from static reports to a dynamic, visual system to enable data-driven decision.

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic
## Insight
  - Workforce Stability: The largest employment status group is Full-Time (20 employees), suggesting a stable core workforce, but the Contract (17 employees) group     is nearly as large, indicating significant reliance on contingent staff.
  - Gender Parity: The split between Males (52%) and Females (48%) is nearly equal, suggesting strong gender balance in the overall headcount.
